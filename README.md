# Euler_Method
📌 Overview

This Python script implements the Euler Method for solving first-order differential equations numerically. It takes an initial value, step size, and a differential equation to compute approximate solutions.

🚀 Features

📈 Solves first-order differential equations numerically.

🏷️ Accepts custom differential equations in terms of x and y.

🔢 Allows user-defined step size (h) and iterations (n).

📊 Provides iterative results in a structured format.
